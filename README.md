A dictionary and a tester for the people learning German.


This desktop application will provide the ability for a persen to test their skills and knowledge in the not-so-easy-to-learn German language. It'll have two major work modes. The first one will be a dictionary - when in doubt, the person, using the app can check the meaning of the word (provided in English), the definite article of a noun, etc. When in the other mode - 'Pr√ºfung mode', the user can see how much they have learnt so far. They can try matching a german word with it's english meaning and vice versa. They'll be able to fill in the gaps with the missing article in the CORRECT grammatical case: nominativ, akkusativ, dativ and genitiv. Also, there'll be a check to correctly coordinate adjectives with the following nouns.
